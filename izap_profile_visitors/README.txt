The plugin allows to add a widget to the profile page / dashboard that shows the latest site members who visited this profile page. If this visitor is currently online, the icon shown in the widget has a green border. The number of visitors shown can be adjusted (5, 10, 15 , 20).


REMARK TO AVAILABILITY OF THIS PLUGIN:

Due to the licence (GPLv3) it's currently not possible to add this plugin to the Elgg community repository. I would have preferred for the original plugin to be released under GPLv2 and would have kept the licence unchanged when upgrading the plugin. But the GPLv3 can not be downgraded to GPL2.



Installation:

1. Copy the izap-profile-visitors folder in the mod directory of your Elgg installation,
2. Enable the plugin in the admin section,
3. The widget is available to be added to profile pages/dashboards.
